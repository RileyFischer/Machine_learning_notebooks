# Machine_learning
This repository is meant to showcase some of the more advance machine learning methods that I have learned. This code speciffically documents the general things that I learned in a class(ECE 539) I took during my masters degree, which focuses on Artificial Neural Networks.

Some of the topics that are covered here are:

-Pattern classification: nearest neighbor, na√Øve Bayesian, decision 

-tree, Principal component Analysis, linear discriminant analysis

-Linear regression, logistic regression

-Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and back-propagation (BP)

-Deep neural network

-Encoder/decoder architecture

-Recurrent neural network, Long-term, short term recurrent neural network, transformer

-Convolutional neural network (CNN)

-Support vector machine (SVM)

-Clustering: Kmeans, spectral, DBSCAN

-Ensemble method, random forests
